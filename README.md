# Portfolio

Portfolio I made for myself to showcase the projects I've developed over the years and provide information about myself as well as my contact details. This is where everything I learnt about web developing is put to use. It was also used to experiment with different technologies that I wasn't able to do for coursework.

## [v1](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v1/)

I initially made [version 1](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v1/) in April 2015 to revise for a test for a unit during my degree on basic HTML & CSS.

## [v2](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v2/)

In the summer of 2016 I decided to put the portfolio online, but I thought it needed major updates first. So I went and updated the site with new content & features I have learnt in the past year also with some experiments. Therefore this was the start of [version 2](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v2/).

##### Work done in release:

-   An CMS page where projects have CRUD capabilities via an API & database
-   The projects & homepage display projects via API (Including a projects search)
-   3 custom built slide shows for display project images
-   New styling (integrated Bootstrap3, with some custom CSS3)
-   New content (Contact form, XML site map & custom error pages)
-   Custom sticky footer

## [v3](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v3/)

In early 2017 I was coming to the end of my degree, I wanted to use my portfolio to aid getting my first graduate job, but also knew it needs to be top quality. Therefore prompting [version 3](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v3/) of my site. So this consisted of fresh new content also to showcase my expansive knowledge base I added more experiments that weren't learnt from education.

##### Work done in release:

-   Update styling (use SCSS and add animate.css & wow.js)
-   AngularJS for the CMS
-   More accessible & valid code
-   More feedback on user events & system errors

## [v4](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v4/)

What started off [version 4](https://github.com/jahidulpabelislam/portfolio/tree/releases/tag/v4/) was due to the fact, I had been in a commercial job developing, and now had experience of how sites/apps are developed on a production level, I thought I'd use that knowledge on my own site and do a major overhaul. This project started in the summer of 2017 and finished in the summer of 2018.

##### Work done in release:

-   All custom styling (remove Bootstrap3, animate.css & wow.js)
-   Major update of content & add new content
-   More secure API, CMS & older projects
-   Update API URI structure
-   Add CMS page & projects page rooting
-   SEO
-   General tidy up (code, file, folder structures & minify asset files)
-   Use BEM & use element classes not ID's
