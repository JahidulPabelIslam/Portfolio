# Mind-Map

For part of my coursework during the third & final year for my degree (2017), I with a group of two others were tasked to design and develop a web application that will help with teachers teaching and students learn.

We decided to create a mind mapping web app for collaborative note taking.

We used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & vis.js visualization library for the display of the mind map.
